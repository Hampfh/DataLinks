title: What is datalinks? 
---

DataLinks is a web application aiming to gather content in an easy-to-reach way and at the same time provide users to contribute with a Wikipedia-like approach. The site is built on workspaces that can be implemented for different programs where all content is contained. Thus every year's program has its own space where they gather important information such as quotes, texts, links, and deadlines in an easy-to-access way.

Everybody associated with kth are allowed to make changes to the site by logging in via [kth's openid connect login system](https://intra.kth.se/en/it/natverk/identitetshantering/konfigurationsinformation-for-saml-openid-connect-1.1045571) which the application is using for authentication. This is primarily to provide a proper way to trace changes and make sure that the site is not abused in any unintended way.

DataLinks currently primarly consists of two applications, a [client](Client/intro-client) and a [server](Server/intro-server) which you can read more about in the documentation.
